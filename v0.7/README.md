# AltDrag v0.7

2009-04-24:
- Added `StickyScreen` which makes windows automatically stick to the screen borders without needing shift (off by default).
- Added the ability to roll-up windows by double-clicking with the middle mouse button.
- Fixed some bugs in `ExperimentalFeatures`, it's working pretty well now so give it a try.
- Fixed an annoying error message that sometimes popped up when AltDrag was on autostart.
