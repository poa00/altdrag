# AltDrag v0.9b1

2010-12-23:
- Added `Aero` option. Alt-drag windows to the left, right and top side of the screen. Corners work too!
- Added new mouse actions: `AlwaysOnTop` and `Close`.
- Replaced roll-up behavior with `Aero` behavior. Double-click with middle/right mouse button.
- Renamed "stick" to "snap" as people seem to "get" that term better.
- Fixed some bugs that prevented `HookWindows` from working properly.
- Tweaked the blacklist.
