# AltDrag v0.8

2009-11-15:
- Added `AutoStick`, enable it to make windows always stick without needing to press shift. This replaces `StickyScreen`.
- Renamed `ExperimentalFeatures` to `HookWindows`, also improved it so resizing is now supported and windows should no longer flicker. 64-bit programs also work now. I no longer consider it experimental!
- The alt key will no longer activate the window menu!
- Added the ability to configure what keys should trigger the dragging, resizing, etc.
- Added the ability to configure what the mouse buttons do. New actions: minimize and center.
- Improved multi-monitor support a lot.
- Tweaked the blacklist.
