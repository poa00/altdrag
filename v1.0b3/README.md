- If you enable `InactiveScroll`, you can now hold the shift key to scroll horizontally. Note that this only works in programs that have implemented horizontal scrolling.
- New scroll action: `Transparency`. It allows you to set the transparency of arbitrary windows.
- The code that prevents the window menu from triggering has been reworked to work with Internet Explorer.
